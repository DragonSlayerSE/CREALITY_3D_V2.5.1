On the latest firmware from Creality 2022-08 the Marlin "HOST_ACTION_COMMAND" are not enabled.. 
This means that you can only print from SD-card reliably .. when connecting a PC or something else like "Octoprint" or "Creality Box" a pause comand are not sent to the host if for example the filamnet runs out.
Also when printing from USB the tuchscreen does not know

The Hotend termistor is connected on an extension board and then connected to the motherboard via the A12 SGV connector..
the manual mentions that that as a "PT-100 Line" i dont now the exact type of thermistor but a PT-100 should give 100Ohms at 0℃ i messured about 108 Ohms at about 22℃
there is a resister about 770 ohms by the THB, TH1 & TH2 connectors 

The Extemsion board is marked "HQPCB-2 E469747" and have the following ports
FAN, FAN-1, FAN-K, FAN-K1, HEATER, HEATER1 and two unmarked one 3-pin and one where the termistor is connected

The Bed is connected via an Relay card

The LED-light is connected to HEATER2 port

The case fans are connected to K-FAN-1 (i belive it is parallel connected with the part-cooling fan connected to K-FAN
