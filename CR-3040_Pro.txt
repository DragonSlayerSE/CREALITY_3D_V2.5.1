On the latest firmware from Creality 2022-08 the Marlin "HOST_ACTION_COMMAND" are not enabled.. 
This means that you can only print from SD-card reliably .. when connecting a PC or something else like "Octoprint" or "Creality Box" a pause command are not sent to the host, if for example the filamnet runs out.
Also when printing from USB the tuchscreen does not know

The Hotend termistor is connected on an extension board and then connected to the motherboard via the A12 SGV connector..
the manual mentions that that as a "PT-100 Line" i dont now the exact type of thermistor but a PT-100 should give 100Ohms at 0℃ i messured about 108 Ohms at about 22℃
there is a resister about 770 ohms by the THB, TH1 & TH2 connectors 

The Extemsion board is marked "HQPCB-2 E469747" and have the following ports

The LED-light is connected to HEATER2 port

The case exhaust fans are connected to K-FAN2 (i belive it is parallel connected with the part-cooling fan connected to K-FAN1
if i connect fans to LASER1 or LASER2 it seams to be the same control as K-FAN1 but at a slower speed

in the manual it states a case fan is connected to FAN2 connector but this is the Filament Extruder motor cooling fan

FAN1 is connected to a fan blowing over the motherboard

Motherboard can be flashed via USB using the Creality Slicer software, or via klipper (kiauh)
